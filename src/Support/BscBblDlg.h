//My equivalent of MFC's CDialog.  This exists primarily so that I can divorce my code from the MFC,
//hopefully making it more cross-platformy, and allowing me at the very least to use MS's Visual C++
//2005 Express, the free (but non-mfc) version of their C++ compiler.
//
//Example of usage (you don't have to derived your own class, can use as-is if that works for you):
//1) Derive a class from this one, e.g., CBscBblDlg_Custom
//2) Implement your derived constructor like this:
//CBscBblDlg_Custom::CBscBblDlg_Custom(WORD wTemplate, HINSTANCE hInstance, HWND hParent, 
//                    bool const bCreateModelessOnConstruction, bool const bDeferModelessCreation) :
//    CBscBblDlg(wTemplate, hInstance, hParent, bCreateModelessOnConstruction, true /*MUST*==true*/)
//{
//    //Your custom-construction code (if any, e.g., ADD_MSG_HANDLER calls) goes here
//
//    if ((bCreateModelessOnConstruction) && (!bDeferModelessCreation))
//        CreateIt();
//}
//3) (Optional) add any messge handlers for messages that you want to handle
//e.g.,
//To handle the WM_DESTROY message in a dialog class of your own:
//Add this to your derived class .h, in the "Protected" section:
//DECLARE_MSG_HANDLER(OnDestroy, CBscBblDlg_Custom);
//Add this to your derived class .cpp, in the constructor, BEFORE "CreateIt" is called (so for
//modal dialogs, this is automatic, for modeless ones, it needs to happen before you call CreateIt):
//ADD_MSG_HANDLER(WM_DESTROY, OnDestroy);
//Add a function to your CPP that will be called when WM_DESTROY is received:
//long CFSLDlg::OnDestroy(unsigned long const nNULL, long const lNULL)
//{
//    Your code goes here
//    return 1;
//}
//4) (Optional) add any WM_COMMAND messages that you'd like to handle (you could do this as above, 
//and implement a big switch statement to handle the WM_COMMANDs from different dialog controls,
//but doing it as described below will make life easier!
//e.g., to handle a button press from a button with ID IDC_BUTTON_CONNECT:
//Do as per 3), above, but instead of using ADD_MSG_HANDLER, use ADD_CMD_HANDLER:
//ADD_CMD_HANDLER(IDC_BUTTON_CONNECT, OnButtonConnect);
//Your handler only gets the high half of the wParam, as the low half is the IDC_ id (which you can
//infer, as your handler function only gets called for the IDC_ you specify).
//There isn't currently any scope for defining a single handler to cope with messages from mulitple
//controls (well you can do it but you can't know which control was activated).
//5)Your class is now ready to use:
//a) Modal usage (similar to MFC CDialog::DoModal):
//Create an instance of your dialog, making sure to set bCreateModelessOnConstruction false, then
//just do myIntance.DoModal().
//b) Modeless usage:
//Create an instance of your dialog, setting bCreateModelessOnConstruction true.
//
// NOTE: USERS OF THIS CLASS ABSOLUTELY MUST NOT USE SetWindowLong() ON THE CLASS's HWND!
// I use the WindowLong internally to store pThis.  There may be a better way to do it, I'm not sure.
